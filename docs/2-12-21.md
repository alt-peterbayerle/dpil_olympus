## Update 1: Animations 
I added fade-in/fade-out and sliding animations to the posts in the linear view.

The gif is only 15 frames/second ... the animation looks smoother in [the browser](https://dpil-olympus.herokuapp.com/).

I think the animations make the post movement a lot cleaner/less jarring. They also reinforce the impermanence of the posts to the user
