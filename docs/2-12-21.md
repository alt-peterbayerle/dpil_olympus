## Update 1: Animations 
I added a fade-in/fade-out and sliding animation to the posts in the linear view (note: the gif is only 15 frames/second ... the animation looks smoother in the browser). The animations make the post movement a lot cleaner/less jarring than before. They also reinforce the impermanence of the posts to the user
